## AWS Development Environment Setup:

To run the code in these files in your own environment, you will need to install some Python dependencies and have access to an AWS environment.

### Steps to Set Up AWS Development Environment:

1. **Create an AWS Account and an IAM User**  
   Follow this guide for more details: [AWS Account Setup Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-overview.html)

2. **Generate Access Keys for Your IAM User**  
   For more information, see here: [Creating Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)

3. **Install the AWS CLI**  
   Follow this guide for more details: [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

4. **Configure AWS CLI**  
   Run `aws configure` with your access keys, and set the default region to `'us-west-2'` for this code. For more information, see here: [Configuring AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-methods)

5. **Use Boto3 for AWS SDK in Python**  
   Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python, which allows your locally run code to interact with your AWS account. For more information, see: [Boto3 Documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)

### Requirements File

This code was developed and tested on **Python 3.11**.

```bash
boto3==1.28.68
```
